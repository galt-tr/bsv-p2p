/**
 * SECURITY NOTE – NON-AUTHENTICATED KEY EXCHANGE
 *
 * This encrypted message protocol does NOT implement a formally authenticated
 * key exchange (AKE). Session keys are deterministically derived from long-term
 * identity keys and a sender-chosen invoice value.
 *
 * As a result, this protocol does NOT provide:
 *  - Forward secrecy
 *  - Replay protection
 *  - Explicit authentication of peer identity
 *
 * This scheme SHOULD NOT be used for high-value, long-lived, or sensitive
 * communications. It is intended for lightweight messaging where both parties
 * already possess each other's long-term public keys and accept these risks.
 *
 * Future versions may introduce a protocol upgrade based on a standard AKE
 * (e.g. X3DH, Noise, or SIGMA).
