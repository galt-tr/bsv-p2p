## Memory Improvements Applied
Implemented 4 memory best practices from @KSimback's guide:
1. **Memory Flush** — enabled at 40k token threshold, saves decisions/state/lessons/blockers before compaction
2. **Context Pruning** — TTL upgraded 1h → 6h, keepLastAssistants: 3
3. **Hybrid Search** — vector (0.7) + BM25 (0.3), sources: memory + sessions
4. **Session Memory Indexing** — tried `experimental.sessionMemory` but openclaw rejected unrecognized key; removed it

## Mission Control Dashboard — LIVE at localhost:3333
- Built from @AlexFinn's viral article (https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2024169334344679783)
- **Tech:** NextJS 14 + SQLite (better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM) + Tailwind, dark theme
- **6 pages:** Dashboard, Tasks Board, Memory Browser, Calendar, Team, Content Pipeline, Office
- **5 REST APIs:** /api/tasks, /api/events, /api/team, /api/content, /api/memory
- Dylan chose SQLite over Convex (no vendor lock-in)
- I built it by hand after Claude Code crashed twice
- Running via `npm run dev -- -p 3333` (background process, needs systemd service)

### Team Roster (seeded)
- 👤 Dylan (Boss), 🐆 Ghanima (Main Agent), 💻 Coder, ✍️ Writer, 🔍 Researcher
- Tasks assigned to specific team members by name
- HEARTBEAT.md updated to check task board every heartbeat cycle

### Task Board Automation
- Dylan wants me to assign tasks to agents based on context and work the backlog proactively
- Heartbeat checks the task board, picks highest-priority todo, works on it or spawns sub-agent
- Assignment rules: Dylan=human decisions, Ghanima=general, Coder=dev, Writer=docs, Researcher=analysis

## Claude Code + PTY Bug
- **Root cause:** Claude Code crashes with `pty:true` on this machine. Works fine without PTY (`-p` flag).
- The error is in google-auth-library bundled inside Claude Code's CLI (TypeError on `.prototype`)
- **Workaround:** Use `claude -p` (non-interactive print mode) instead of `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` with PTY
- **Lesson:** The coding-agent skill says to always use `pty:true` but that's wrong for this environment

## Browser/X Access
- Browser extension relay works for fetching X/Twitter articles
- yt-dlp installed but doesn't extract tweet text (API errors)
- Browser snapshot via Chrome extension is the working method
- Need Dylan to have the extension attached to a tab

## BSV P2P Project Review
- **What's built:** libp2p node (systemd service), payment channels (open/pay/close), channel storage, protocol handler, gateway integration, 61 passing tests
- **What's broken:** 29 tests fail due to better-sqlite3 NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch (compiled for Node 22, running Node 25)
- **What's missing (20 tasks added to board):**
  - HIGH: Fix sqlite3 mismatch, messages module, transactions module, E2E poem test
  - MEDIUM: Skill integration, protobuf schemas, BRC-105 fallback, GossipSub discovery, peer announcements, dispute detection, CLI, force-close, replay protection, integration tests, docs
  - LOW: Identity attestation, WebSocket, peer scoring, rate limiting, stability audit
- Architecture plan is ~40% implemented. Foundation works but formal protocols, service discovery, and isolated tx module are gaps.

## Rivertowne Country Club Tee Times
- Checked Friday Feb 20 tee sheet via browser (logged in as Dylan Murray)
- Earliest available: 12:42 PM (1 spot). Morning fully booked.
- Dylan declined to book.

## Blockers
- **Node v25.6.1** — bleeding edge, causes issues with better-sqlite3 native modules and Claude Code PTY. Dylan should consider installing Node 22 LTS alongside.
- **Memory search disabled** — OpenAI embeddings API returns 403 (project lacks access to text-embedding-3-small model)
- **Mission Control not persistent** — needs systemd service to survive reboots
