# 2026-02-20

## Treasury Funded
- Dylan sent 184,729 sats to treasury address `18vC3MuEjoDMEaSd71AmWM4ztesAPRqvsa`
- TXID: `58a6e2a5ba3c31438043af43f4354ccf908a174718d8d9717a37856baa732547`
- Old wallet (`1Dodgcnetv9bkMxVvrD18XTMZ7u76WtXgJ`) keys were lost when init.ts regenerated config on Feb 19
- Wiped stale wallet.db UTXOs referencing old address
- Updated MEMORY.md with lesson learned

## Tickets Updated
- #124 closed as duplicate (init.ts already exists)
- #114 simplified to just parameterize existing init.ts
- #125, #113, #130 updated to point at existing ~/.bsv-p2p/ treasury
- #150 filed for \n txid corruption bug (wallet DB wiped so moot)

- #159 → Leto: 1,000 sats (encrypted config fallback)
- Notification system working — I got woken for each payment ✅

## Known Issue: Inbox Import Script Broken
- `process-inbox.ts` fails with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` from libp2p import
- Agent wallet DBs are empty — inbox files accumulating but not imported
- MC team_members table has correct balances (tracked separately)
- On-chain txs are confirmed — no funds at risk, just a local DB sync issue
- FIX NEEDED: decouple inbox processor from libp2p imports

## Bounty Payment Processed (10:26 PM)
